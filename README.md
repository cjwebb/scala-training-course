# Scala Training Course

This course is split into several sessions. At the end of each session, you should have learnt something, and written some Scala to demonstrate what you have learnt.

Each session builds upon the last, and along the way, you'll learn how to build a Play Framework application from scratch. At the end of the course you should be comfortable with diving into an unfamiliar codebase, be able to write a Scala application from scratch, and feel confident enough to continue your Scala understanding unassisted.

Aside from the above goals, this course had these in objectives in mind:

 - Be easy to follow, and be easy to teach.
 - Build things to demonstrate what weâ€™ve learnt.
 - Not be fully comprehensive. This is a framework of essentials, to get you up to speed.
 - It is okay to miss out details, if links for further reading and understanding are provided.

### Work In Progress

This course is also a work in progress. It is being developed, and delivered, at the same time. As such, there may be drastic changes until it has been run through at least once.
